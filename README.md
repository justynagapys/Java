## Exercises in programming in Java

A repository created for the purposes of classes at the university, monitoring progress in programming in Java.

Exercises based on the book **"Thinking in Java"** written by Bruce Eckel.

Exercises have been written using **IntelliJ - IDE**.

You can download this tool here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows

You also need to install **Java Development Kit**: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html

Here you can find program that:
* draws 6 numbers (**TotoLotek**)
* inverts words of sentence (**OdwrocenieZdania**)
* replaces the first character with the last of the sentence given by the user (**ZamianaZnakow**)
* multiplies matrices (**MnozenieMacierzy**)

and others, as well as Windows Forms applications, such as **LiczbaPierwsza**, which checks if the number is prime.
